Misspelling of the function name: The function intmain() should be replaced with int main() with a space between int and main.
Missing namespace and header file: The program uses cout and endl which are defined in the std namespace and requires the iostream 
header file to be included at the beginning of the program.
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "\"geeksforgeeks\"";
    return 0;
}

this is the corrected code
