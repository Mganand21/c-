The original code has a few errors:

The header file iostream.h is outdated and should be replaced with iostream.
The main function should have a return type of int, not void.
The insertion operator << should be used to output the value of i+j to the console, not the extraction operator >>.
The compound assignment operator >>= should not be used to output a value to the console
#include<iostream>
int main()
{
    short i=2500, j=3000;
    std::cout << "i+j = " << i+j << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
