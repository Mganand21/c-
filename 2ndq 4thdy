The given program uses the bitwise XOR operator (^) to compare the values of x and y. 
The expression x ^ y returns zero if x and y are equal, and a non-zero value if they are not equal. The logical NOT operator (!) is
then applied to this expression, which will result in a true value if x and y are equal, and a false value if they are not equal.
Therefore, the output of this program will be:
x is equal to y
This is because x and y have been initialized to the same value of 10,
so the condition !(x ^ y) evaluates to true, and the program
outputs "x is equal to y".
