The program declares a variable called "new" and prints its value using printf.
In C, the program will compile and execute without any issues because "new" is not a reserved keyword in C, and it is allowed to use it as a variable name. However,
using "new" as a variable name in C++ is not recommended because "new" is a reserved keyword in C++, and it is used for dynamic memory allocation.
In C++, the program will not compile because "new" is a reserved keyword in C++. This will cause a compilation error indicating that "new" is an invalid identifier.
To fix the program in C++, the variable name "new" should be changed to a valid identifier that is not a reserved keyword. For example, we can rename it to "newInt" as
follows:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(void) 
{ 
    int newInt = 5;
    cout << newInt; 
    return 0;
}

After using these code it can be executed in both c and c++
