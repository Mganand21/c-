The iostream header file is not included, which means that the cout object will not be recognized.
The main function should return an int value, but it is declared as void.
The using namespace std directive is missing, which means that the std namespace is not explicitly used.
There is no semicolon after the first cout statement.
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{

    int i = 0;
    i = i + 1;
    cout << i << " ";
    cout << i << endl;
    return 0;
}
